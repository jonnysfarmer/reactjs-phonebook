## React Project - Full Stack Open
A Course run by the University of Helsinki and Finnish Houston Inc written by Matti Luukkainen

### Overview
I completed this project using the material in this course.  It gave self directed exercises at the end of each section with the idea of creating a full phonebook project using React.

### So far I have used
 - REACT
 - UseEffect and UseState hooks
 - APIs and created my own local host backend


 
### Update
This was completed during the first few weeks of my course for additional study.  I have temporarily put this on hold whilst we learn REACT and will hopefully revisit with new skills
