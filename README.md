## React Project - Full Stack Open
A Course run by the University of Helsinki and Finnish Houston Inc written by Matti Luukkainen

### Overview
I completed this project using the material in this course.  It gave self directed exercises at the end of each section with the idea of creating a full phonebook project using React.

### So far I have used
 - REACT
 - UseEffect and UseState hooks
 - APIs and created my own local Json backend
 - and MORE !!

 
### Current Stage
I have created a working website (that is also mobile friendly), that allows you to add and delete names and telephone numbers.  Saving them into a back end and manipulating that data.
